## Overview Project
Listify is a project created to meet the needs of the Algorithm and Data Structure course. This project aims to implement queuing techniques in making item list applications.

The Listify application will allow users to list items by using a queue data structure. A queue is a data structure that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, which means that the first item entered will be the first item to come out.

In Listify, users can add items to the queue, delete items that are in front of the queue, view all items, view items by category and manage queue capacity.

This project implements algorithms and data structures relevant to queuing techniques, such as enqueue (adding items to the queue) and dequeue (removing items from the front of the queue) operations.
